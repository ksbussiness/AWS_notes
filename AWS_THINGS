AWS _S3 :

.> When you create a bucket in cloud storage (like AWS S3), one important concept is who owns the objects (files) that are uploaded into
the bucketâ€”this is controlled by ACL (Access Control List) settings and ownership options.

.> By default, the uploader becomes the object owner â€” even if the bucket belongs to someone else (like in team projects, or uploads from different accounts).

What is ACL (Access Control List)?
ACLs are a legacy way to manage permissions in buckets and objects. It allows you to set individual read/write permissions for users or groups on a per-object or per-bucket basis.


 ACLs Enabled (Object ACLs: Enabled)
Every object has its own ACL.
The person/account that uploads the object is the owner of that object.
Ownership and permissions are controlled per object.
You can grant read/write access using the object's ACL settings.
ðŸŸ¡ Example:
If User A creates a bucket and User B uploads a file, then User B owns the object. Unless User B explicitly gives permission via ACL, User A (bucket owner) cannot access or control it.


 ACLs Disabled (Object ACLs: Disabled â€” Recommended)
All objects uploaded to the bucket are automatically owned by the bucket owner (regardless of who uploads them).
You cannot set per-object permissions via ACL.
IAM policies are used instead for permissions (more secure and recommended).
ðŸŸ¢ Example:
User A owns the bucket. If User B uploads a file, the object is still owned by User A. No conflict in access or permission happens.


Billing for the AWS S3 BUcket:
------------------------------------- >

. PUT Object ACL / GET Object ACL / DELETE Object ACL
These are considered API calls.

AWS S3 charges per 1,000 requests, including:
PutObjectAcl
GetObjectAcl
DeleteObjectAcl

Example: If you update or retrieve ACLs for many objects (especially in automation), you are billed per request.

2. Cross-Account Uploads
If an object is uploaded by another AWS account and ACLs are used to grant access:
Data transfer or replication costs might be incurred depending on how access is shared or replicated.

3. Public Access (via ACL)
If ACLs are used to make objects public (e.g., everyone can read), and many people download them:
You may get charged for data transfer (outbound).
